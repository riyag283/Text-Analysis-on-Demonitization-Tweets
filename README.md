# Text-Analysis-on-Demonitization-Tweets
Text Analysis using R to test whether demonetization had majority popular support in India.
From a given set of about 15,000 Twitter messages, all supposedly about demonetization (in the attachment, downloaded from Kaggle).

1. The data is Loaded and the text is analyzed using R after some pre-processing and cleaning-up as required, using tokenizer, stemmer, counting some word frequencies, recognizing phrases, etc.

2. Additional Twitter messages on the same or related topics, is downloaded, and added to the data set. 

3. Sentiment analysis on the messages is performed.

4. Discovered several major classes of messages, i.e., cluster and/or classify them into a few groups of related messages (based on their textual content in addition to other attributes). Classification based only on timestamp, sender, etc. is not valid.

5. Generated some form of visualization of the messages.

6. Testing of the hypothesis that demonetization had majority popular support is done, based on the results from above steps.
